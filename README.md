# BirdWatchingWebsite

### Objective	

To test knowledge of web page structures, and how to represent a prospective layout design in markup.

### Project brief
1. For this project, your first task is to refactor the file structure. At the moment everything is placed in the project root directory. This is not at all ideal for the overview. 

**Add project structure:**
* Place only HTML files in the root folder
* Make a directory to store image files
* Make a directory to store stylesheets
* Update all references in `index.html` to match new file paths


2. Your next task is to take the content for the homepage of a bird watching website and add structural elements to it so it can have a page layout applied to it. 

**It needs to have:**
* A header spanning the full width of the site containing the main title for the page, the site logo, and the navigation menu. The title and logo appear side by side once styling is applied, and the navigation appears below those two items.
* A main content area containing two columns â€” a main block to contain the welcome text, and a sidebar to contain image thumbnails.
* A footer containing copyright information and credits.

### You need to add a suitable wrapper element for

* The header
* The navigation menu
* The main content
* The welcome text
* The image sidebar
* The footer

### You should also

Apply the provided CSS to the page by adding another <link> element just below the existing one provided at the start.
You **don't** need to know any CSS to do this assessment; you just need to put the provided CSS inside an HTML element.

### To get this assessment started 
You should go and grab the zip file containing all the starting assets.

**The zip file contains:**
* The HTML you need to add structural markup to.
* CSS to style your markup.
* Images that are used on the page.

**Hint and help:**

* The provided CSS is designed so that when the correct structural elements are added to the markup, they will appear green in the rendered page.<br>
